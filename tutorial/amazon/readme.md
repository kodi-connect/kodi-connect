# Amazon Developer and AWS Account

You will need to have a valid Amazon Developer, and AWS account. These are free to sign up for.

For Amazon Developer, go to their page (developer.amazon.com), and click "Sign In". From there, you can click "Create your Amazon Developer account".

For Amazon Web Services (AWS), go to their page (aws.amazon.com), and click "Sign Up". It will ask you for a credit card, but do not worry - AWS includes a "free tier". The service that haaska uses, AWS Lambda, will allow up to 1,000,000 requests, per month, free. You can read more here: AWS Lambda - Pricing.

For your own safety, you are encouraged to look at Billing, and set limits/budgets, just in case. If you use other AWS Services, they may be subject to a cost.
